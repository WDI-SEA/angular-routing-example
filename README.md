# Angular Routing
An example of how to route different views in an Angular App.

Warning: you can't simply open the index.html file in your browser. The file must
be served by a local HTTP server. This is because Angular uses AJAX to request
the view template files.

Use the `http-server` node module to start a simple HTTP server in your current
directory. This server will just serve files in your current directory.

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Notice: you'll have to visit the address that the server prints when it starts.
You should visit <http://127.0.0.1:3000> instead of trying to go to `localhost`
like you may be used to with nodemon.

# Installation
- Fork or clone this repositoy
- cd into the directory
- run `http-server`
- visit <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
